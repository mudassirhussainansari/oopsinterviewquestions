## ✅ **Top Java OOP Interview Questions & Answers (Interview Style)**

---

# **1️⃣ What is OOP?**

**Answer:**
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of **objects** and **classes**. It helps in writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
Java implements OOP through principles like **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.

---

# **2️⃣ What is a Class and an Object?**

### **Class**

A blueprint/template that defines properties and behaviors.

### **Object**

A real instance created from a class.

**Example:**

```java
class Car {
   String brand;
   void start() {}
}

Car c = new Car(); // object
```

---

# **3️⃣ What is Encapsulation?**

**Answer:**
Encapsulation means **binding data (variables) and methods (functions)** into a single unit and restricting direct access using **private** fields and **public getters/setters**.

**Why used?**
✔ Protects data
✔ Controls access
✔ Improves maintainability

---

# **4️⃣ What is Inheritance?**

**Answer:**
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class using the `extends` keyword.

**Example:**

```java
class Animal { void eat() {} }
class Dog extends Animal { void bark() {} }
```

**Benefits:**
✔ Code reusability
✔ Method overriding
✔ Supports hierarchical relationships

---

# **5️⃣ What is Polymorphism?**

### **Answer:**

Polymorphism means **one name, many forms**.

### Two types:

1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
2. **Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

**Example:**

```java
class A { void show() {} }
class B extends A { void show() {} }  // overriding
```

---

# **6️⃣ What is Method Overloading?**

**Answer:**
Method Overloading happens when multiple methods share the same name but differ in **parameters**.

**Occurs at:** Compile-time.

---

# **7️⃣ What is Method Overriding?**

**Answer:**
When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class, it’s overriding.

**Occurs at:** Runtime.

---

# **8️⃣ What is Abstraction?**

**Answer:**
Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only necessary features.

**Achieved by:**
✔ Abstract Class
✔ Interface

---

# **9️⃣ Abstract Class vs Interface**

| Feature     | Abstract Class      | Interface                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Methods     | Abstract + Concrete | Abstract (Java 8+ default & static allowed) |
| Variables   | Final or non-final  | Always `public static final`                |
| Inheritance | Single              | Multiple                                    |
| Use Case    | Partial abstraction | Full abstraction                            |

---

# **🔟 What is a Constructor?**

**Answer:**
A constructor initializes objects.
It has the same name as the class and no return type.

**Types:**

1. Default
2. Parameterized
3. Copy constructor (manual in Java)

---

# **1️⃣1️⃣ What is ‘super’ keyword?**

**Answer:**
`super` is used to access **parent class variables, methods, and constructors**.

```java
super();        // call parent constructor
super.show();   // call parent method
```

---

# **1️⃣2️⃣ What is ‘this’ keyword?**

**Answer:**
`this` refers to the current object.

Used for:
✔ Avoiding variable shadowing
✔ Calling current class methods
✔ Calling constructors (`this()`)

---

# **1️⃣3️⃣ Can Java support multiple inheritance?**

**Answer:**
Java does **not** support multiple inheritance using classes (to avoid ambiguity), but it **supports it through interfaces**.

---

# **1️⃣4️⃣ What are Access Modifiers?**

* **public** – accessible everywhere
* **private** – accessible only within the class
* **protected** – accessible in same package + subclasses
* **default** – package-private

---

# **1️⃣5️⃣ What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding?**

| Overloading                     | Overriding                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Compile-time                    | Runtime                    |
| Same name, different parameters | Same name, same parameters |
| Same class                      | Parent-child classes       |

---

# **1️⃣6️⃣ What is Composition?**

**Answer:**
Composition is a design principle where one class is made of one or more objects of other classes.

**Example:**

```java
class Engine {}
class Car {
   private Engine engine = new Engine();
}
```

**Strong relationship:** If Car is destroyed, engine also dies.

---

# **1️⃣7️⃣ What is Aggregation?**

**Answer:**
Aggregation is a weak association where one class has a reference to another but can exist independently.

Example:

```java
class Department {}
class Student {
   Department dept;
}
```

---

# **1️⃣8️⃣ What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction?**

| Encapsulation                            | Abstraction                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Hides data                               | Hides implementation                      |
| Achieved using private + getters/setters | Achieved using abstract class & interface |
| Focuses on security                      | Focuses on design                         |

---

# **1️⃣9️⃣ What is an Object Class?**

**Answer:**
`Object` is the root parent class of all Java classes.
It contains methods like:
✔ `toString()`
✔ `equals()`
✔ `hashCode()`
✔ `clone()`
✔ `finalize()`

---

# **2️⃣0️⃣ What is final keyword?**

* **final variable** – constant
* **final method** – cannot be overridden
* **final class** – cannot be inherited
